# TimeTrack

This is a terminal application for managing todo lists. It can track one-off tasks, and tasks that need to be worked on for a specific amount of time every day. It also allows you to start pomodoro sessions,
and picks a task for you to do in those pomodoro sessions so that you can't procrastinate one task by only ever working on other tasks.

# TODO

## Feature: Change state path

It should be possible to use an environment variable to change where the state is loaded from and saved to.
